- P′′(P Prime Prime)
- An esoteric/primitive programming language
- Invented by Corrado Böhm in 1964
- Published in paper entitled: "On a family of Turing machines and the related programming language"
  - International Computation Center, bulletin 3, July 1964. Pages 187-194.
- Proven to be Turing-Complete.
- The first imperative, structured, Turing-complete programming language without a GOTO mechanism.
- Consists of only four instructions: R, λ, (, )

- Syntax rules are simple:
  (i)    λ, R ∈ p″
    - λ and R are words in P″
  (ii)   q₁, q₂ ∈ p″ implies q₁q₂ ∈ p″
    - If q₁ and q₂ are words in p″ then q₁q₂ is a word in p″
  (iii)  q ∈ p″ implies (q) ∈ p″
    - If q is a word in P″, then (q) is a word in P″
  (iiii) Only the expressions that can be derived from (i), (ii), (iii) belong to P″
    - There are no more rules

- Is sufficient to provide some simple abstractions to match the instructions of brainfuck exactly
  - r  = λR
    - Increment current cell.
  - r′ = rⁿ
    - r n times, which will decrement current cell. n = size of memory
  - L  = r′λ
    - Move left one cell.
